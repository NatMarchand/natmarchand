Hi, I'm Nathanael !
I'm a software development engineer in the .Net ecosystem. I've been Microsoft MVP for five amazing years.
I use .Net to build great apps that run and scale nicely using Azure services such as App Services, Service Fabric, Containers, Service Bus, etc.
I put a strong emphasis on DevOps culture with Azure DevOps, Terraform.
